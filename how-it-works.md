# How it works

#### The Book of Stamp.

Book of STAMP is a directory of 420 STAMPs on Bitcoin. The directory is a curation effort of anon. OGs in the space that believe Bitcoin STAMPs is a historic value proposition for collectors. With this being said, an effort in curating an onlin/on-chain directory alongside a physical (& limited print) is taking place via Book of STAMP. Thank you for participating and stay tuned for further details related to official Book of STAMP product releases.
