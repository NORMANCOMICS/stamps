# Bitcoin Stamps 'Key Burn' Methodology #

Key Burn is a new technique introduced to address concerns with the spendable outputs that encode the art of a Bitcoin Stamp.

While spending outputs is currently a non-trivial process, tooling is likely to emerge in the near future making the process easy enough. Combined with the large amount of sats embedded in older Stamps' outputs (7800), we recognize the incentive to spend the outputs once tooling makes it easy to do so. That being said, spent outputs would only mean that the art would no longer exist within the UTXO set, but continue to live in the transaction data of the blockchain held by all full nodes.

Key Burn is the first step in addressing this potential issue. We are also working on a redemption method paired with Key Burn that would allow artists to redeem up to 90% of the trapped sats from the outputs before 'burning' the multisig key. We believe this approach should be incentive-compatible with artists.

# The Approach #

Based on 'NFiniTy' by B0B Smith, Key Burn assigns the spending key of the 'fake multisig' to a burn address when a Bitcoin Stamp is minted, making the spendable outputs, effectively, unspendable.

Presently, the STAMPCHAIN.IO minting service does this by default by cycling through a series of known burn addresses which can easily be scrutinized to validate that no private key can practically exist. In the future, this library of burn addresses may grow to address adversarial action.

The very first example of the Key Burn method in use (coined 'NFiniTy') is here: https://xchain.io/asset/SPENDME. By analyzing its scriptPubKey, you will notice that the spendable multisig key address is: '<code>022222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222</code>' which does not have a known Private Key based on the improbable pattern.

The second example of the Key Burn method in use (a valid #Bitcoin Stamp) is here: https://xchain.io/asset/A808022222222222222. Once again, you can examine the scriptPubKey here: https://blockstream.info/tx/f2ac4cf5230e3033968c25d0a4e3f05ea7ba36429dec7e560ae770a732fd7ae8?expand to verify that the spendable multisig key address is: '<code>022222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222</code>'

# Library of current Key Burn addresses: #

<code>022222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222</code>
<code>033333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333</code>
<code>020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202</code>
<code>030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303</code>

We strongly advise other minting services looking to implement Key Burn to use one of the addresses above or work closely with the STAMP protocol developers to ensure that a consolidated list of burn addresses is maintained as we will be badging Bitcoin Stamps in a future update on STAMPCHAIN.IO.

# Badging #

In a future release, Bitcoin Stamps will have 1 of 3 designations based on the state of the spendable outputs and key availability:

* Spent Outputs (Art will likely be blacked-out or faded but numbering will remain intact)
* Unspent Outputs; Key Available
* Unspent Outputs; Key Burned

Special Thanks to B0B Smith, Regan and RÎžINAMORA for devising and coding this solution.
