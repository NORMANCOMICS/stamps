# Numeral Theory #

## Abstract ##

Numeral theory is a fascinating field that involves the characterization and manipulation of numbers, enabling them to have distinct identities and significance. In this paper, we explore the use of numeral theory in creating unique digital artifacts, called STAMPS, that can be transferred using Bitcoin transactions. 

Secure, Tradeable Art Maintained Permanently or 'STAMP' for short is the substrate of a Numeral.

The Numeral itself is a combination of the Alpha Signet and a unique Numismatic Sequence. The Alpha Signet symbolizes the genesis of STAMPS, while the Numismatic Sequence can either represent a distinct signal or simply be random noise, akin to the background radiation of the Universe itself. The significance of a Numeral lies in its ability to immortalize a statement on the blockchain, persisting indefinitely.


## Introduction ##

In the realm of cryptocurrency, numeral theory has played a crucial role in the creation of STAMPS: digital artifacts that can be collected, traded, and transferred using Bitcoin transactions. Individual transaction outputs can be 'stamped', creating unique Bitcoin-native digital artifacts that can be held in Bitcoin wallets and transferred using Bitcoin transactions.

Stamps are as durable, immutable, secure, and decentralized as Bitcoin itself.

## The Numeral Construct ##

A Numeral is defined by the union of the Alpha Signet and a unique Numismatic Sequence.

In the case of the “Yin and Yang” symbol (STAMP #311), its form and shape is transliterated to “69” embedded in the Numeral asset’s name: `A6969000000000000000`

Another example of this is phenomenon is the “BOBO” asset (STAMP #29) transliterated to “8080” in the Numeral asset’s name: `A808011111111111111`

Simple Key Substitution is another noval method of creating a Numismatic Sequence:

A=1<br>
B=2<br>
C=3<br>
...<br>
Z=26

Pick a word, convert it to numbers, and insert it in the Numeral asset's name after the Alpah Signet, then pad the rest of the string with zeros (0) to make the asset name 19 characters long.

For instance, RAREPEPE encoded into a numeric would look like this:

<pre>`R = 18
A = 1
R = 18
E = 5
P = 16
E = 5
P = 16
E = 5`</pre>

`RAREPEPE = 181185165165`

The "RAREPEPE" asset name is then encoded into a numeric asset.

`A1811851651650000000 = RAREPEPE`


## In Summation ##

Numeral theory is still, very much, the frontier land as we learn more and more each day. Yet, we are often reminded of how little we actually know.

Minting a STAMP using Numeral theory means making a statement for posterity. It will outlive your grandchildren on the Blockchain.
